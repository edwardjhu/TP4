Empirical Experiments in "Feature Learning in Infinite-width Neural Networks"
========

This repo contains code to replicate our experiments (Word2Vec, MAML) in our paper

[**Feature Learning in Infinite-Width Neural Networks**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14522)<br>
*Greg Yang, Edward Hu*

In short, the code here will allow you to train feature learning infinite-width neural networks on Word2Vec and on Omniglot (via MAML).

This is the 4th paper in the Tensor Programs series ([[0]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04760)[[1]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12478)[[2]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14548)[[3]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10685)). Also see here for code in previous papers for calculating the [GP](https://github.com/thegregyang/GP4A) and [NTK](https://github.com/thegregyang/NTK4A) limits of wide neural networks.
